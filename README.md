# Scope
The aim of our project is to search for patterns in the CPI for 3 foodstuffs categories: dairy, meats, and fruits and vegetables.  We want to get a general understanding of the data over the last 5 years in these categories and see if any patterns emerge. 

# Research Questions
- Which (if any) of these groups have been subject to higher inflation, and which groups may be avoiding it. 
- Compare the inflation trends over the past 5 years to other time periods and explore for differences.
- What patterns are prevalent among each food category?
- What are the factors that possibly influenced trends in the data during the 5-year timeframe?
