# Scope
The aim of our project is to search for patterns in the CPI for 3 foodstuffs categories: dairy, meats, and fruits and vegetables.  We want to get a general understanding of the data over the last 5 years in these categories and see if any patterns emerge, and then compapre this to historical data. 

# Research Questions
- Which (if any) of these groups have been subject to higher inflation, and which groups may be avoiding it. 
- Compare the inflation trends over the past 5 years to other time periods and explore for differences.
- What patterns are prevalent among each food category?
- What are the factors that possibly influenced trends in the data during the 5-year timeframe?

# Analysis
## General Trends

In total, all categories we analyzed correlated with each other and the general inflation trend. Each individual product has its own variance, but a one-way ANOVA test shows that the means of the data have no sigificant differences, meaning the data is all relatively correlated. 
## Which Group Got it the Worst?
From the data, it's a little bit hard to say. Dairy has the highest recorded inflation of our groups, but it also has the lowest. In total, Dairy is the most volatile group and is impacted more often by inflation than other products. 
## Comparison to Years Past
Outside of the uptick following COVID, the US had not seen inflation changes much greater than 5% since the end of the 1970's. Before the relatively low rates of the 80's on, inflation was high (over 10% annual change in a couple years). The last few years have been a return towards uncertainty in the change in inflation. Over the last 5 years, inflation (between the categories in the study) has a steady upward trend, starting around 2020 and peaking in 2022. In short, inflation is high now, but not near as bad as it was in the 70s. 
## Reprecussions/Other Factors
Around inflationary peaks (high CPI) enrollment in government programs like SNAP see a surge in enrollment. Along with this, periods of high unemployment vs low unemployment correlate with periods of lower vs higher inflation respectively. Markets can be analyzed in their entirety using inflation, since inflation can be used as an indicator for market failures and succesful policy to recover from the failures. High points of inflation are indicitave of a market failure, and low inflation is indicitave of some sort of government policy or market response to the failure.
